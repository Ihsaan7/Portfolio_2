# Vercel Deployment Error Fix

## Issue
When deploying to Vercel, you received the error:
```
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`.
```

## Root Cause
The original `vercel.json` had an incorrect `functions` section with an invalid runtime specification (`nodejs18.x`). Vercel requires either:
1. No functions section (for Vite framework)
2. Proper serverless function configuration with valid runtime format

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` to a simplified configuration that:
- ✅ Uses Vite framework (auto-detected)
- ✅ Removes invalid functions section
- ✅ Sets correct outputDirectory to `dist/public`
- ✅ Specifies proper build and install commands
- ✅ Sets production environment

## Updated vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

## How Your App Works on Vercel

1. **Build Phase**: 
   - Runs `npm run build`
   - Compiles React components with Vite
   - Bundles Node.js server with esbuild
   - Output: `dist/` directory

2. **Static Files**:
   - `dist/public/` contains React build
   - Served directly by Vercel CDN

3. **Server Logic**:
   - `dist/index.js` runs as Node.js runtime
   - Handles `/api/*` routes
   - Falls back to React for other routes

## Next Steps

1. **Retry Deployment**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Click "Redeploy" on the failed deployment
   - Or push a new commit to trigger rebuild

2. **Verify Build Output**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ls -la dist/
   # Should show: dist/public/ (React build) and dist/index.js (server)
   ```

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   # Visit http://localhost:5000
   ```

## If Issues Persist

### Build Still Fails
1. Check Vercel logs for specific error
2. Ensure all dependencies are listed in package.json
3. Run `npm install` locally and verify no errors
4. Run `npm run build` locally to test

### Site Shows 404
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify static files are served (check network tab)
3. Review Vercel logs for routing issues

### Contact Form Not Working
1. Ensure API routes are properly configured
2. Check Vercel logs for server errors
3. Verify environment variables are set
